    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I’m Austin Harrison — a senior Computer Science student at Eastern Washington University, with a 3.9 GPA. I’m also pursuing minors in Machine Learning and Big Data, which reflect my curiosity for intelligent systems and my interest in solving problems with data at scale.</p>

    <p>I’m passionate about creating software that makes life easier, more efficient, or just a little more interesting. Over the past few years, I’ve worked on a wide range of projects — from developing a full-stack parking lot management app for a university project, to building a real-time iOS and Apple Watch app for St. Luke’s Hospital that monitors heart rate variability using HealthKit, Watch Connectivity, and AWS cloud storage. These experiences have helped me grow not only as a developer, but as a teammate, problem solver, and communicator.</p>

    <p>Lately, I’ve been diving deeper into front-end development and React, building small personal projects and contributing to interfaces for machine learning tools. I’m also learning Spring Boot for backend development to round out my skills in full-stack application building. While I’ve spent a lot of time in Python, C#, and Java, I enjoy learning new technologies and tools — and I love the challenge of picking up something new and applying it quickly.</p>

    <p>In addition to technical work, I’ve balanced school with a part-time job as a server for the past few years. It’s taught me a lot about multitasking, staying calm under pressure, and how to work effectively with all kinds of people — skills that carry over surprisingly well to working on software teams.</p>

    <p>I’m currently looking for opportunities to contribute to real-world projects, especially those that allow me to keep learning, collaborate with others, and build something meaningful. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
